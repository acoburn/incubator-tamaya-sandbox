# Sandbox implementation of the JSR 382 API

As long as the API is not properly published to an official Maven repository you need to checkout the sourcecode from:

https://github.com/eclipse/ConfigJSR

Once 
https://github.com/eclipse/ConfigJSR/issues/1
is done we may be able to properly add this module to our builds.
