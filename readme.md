# Apache Tamaya (incubating) Sandbox

This is the sandbox of [Apache Tamaya](http://tamaya.incubator.apache.org).
The sandbox contains additional modules (extensions) 
of Apache Tamaya (incubating) **which are not mature enough** 
to be part of Apache Tamaya itself or the official extensions
of Apache Tamaya.

## Rules for sandbox modules

* All modules must be independent of each other.
* A module could be promoted my the PMC of Tamaya
  to be part of the official Tamaya extensions if is
  mature enough.
* A sandbox module could have it's own build chain
  in [Apache's Jenkins Server](https://builds.apache.org/)
